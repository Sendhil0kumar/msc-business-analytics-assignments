## MSc Business Analytics – Academic Assignments

This repository contains early-stage academic notebooks and assignments completed as part of my MSc in Business Analytics.

These notebooks represent:
- Initial exposure to Python, statistics, and hypothesis testing
- Coursework-driven analysis
- Learning-stage experimentation

They are intentionally archived and separated from my applied business analytics projects.
